Respond with exactly FOUR sections using these exact headers:

## FINANCIAL ADVICE
[One short paragraph (3-4 sentences) of personalized financial advice. Use the exact numbers from the calculated summary above. Mention their biggest lever (e.g. housing, top expense) or what they're doing well. Tailor to their goal: {goal_text}. Be encouraging and realistic.]

## SAVING TIPS
[3 to 5 bullet points with specific, actionable saving tips. Base tips on their exact numbers. If overspending, focus on cutting expenses. If they have remaining money, suggest how to allocate it. Mention emergency fund if relevant. Tailor to goal: {goal_text}. No specific products.]

## SAVING PLAN (3-6 MONTHS)
[Create a realistic timeline with 2 phases:
- "Months 1-3": 2-3 specific actions with target savings percentage
- "Months 4-6": 2-3 next steps to build on progress
Use their current savings rate ({savings_pct:.1f}%) as starting point. Make small, achievable steps. Tailor to goal: {goal_text}.]

## WHERE SAVINGS COULD GO
[One short paragraph only. Explain in general terms where people often put savings after building an emergency fund: e.g. high-yield savings accounts, retirement accounts like 401(k) or IRA, broad market index funds. Do NOT recommend specific funds or products. End with: "Talk to a licensed financial advisor for your situation."]
